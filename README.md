Pointless Window Manager
========================
PWM is a simplistic tiling window manager written in python 3.

Dependencies
------------
* python3
* python-cffi
* libxcb
* xcb-util
* cairo

PWM uses python-cffi to communicate directly with xcb and cairo.
Therefore no further wrapper libraries are needed.
